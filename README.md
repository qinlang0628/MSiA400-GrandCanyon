Project description:

Job posting data offers a rich source of insight on companiesâ€™ future activities, since jobs are often posted, and hence publicly visible, 3-6 months before hiring takes place. Recent studies have shown that hiring data input can be used to develop models that yield over 80% correlation to future financial metrics such as EBITDA, operating margin, and gross sales.

This study seeks to advance the practice of developing models that are predictive of future stock performance based on hiring data inputs.
